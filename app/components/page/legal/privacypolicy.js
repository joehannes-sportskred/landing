  <h5>COOKIES</h5>
  <p>Our site (like most platforms) uses cookies and other similar technology such as ‘web beacons’</p>
  <p><b>What are Cookies?</b></p>
  <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer
    or mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. Cookies are then sent back to the
    originating site on each subsequent visit, or to another site that recognises that cookies. You can
    find out more information about cookies at
    <a href="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Cookies are widely used in order to make sites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to
    provide information to the owners of the platform.
  </p>
  <p>We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering your
    language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our site is used. Cookies may tell
    us, for example, whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor. They can
    also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
  </p>
  <p><b>Types of Cookies</b></p>
  <p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First Party Cookies, served directly to your computer or mobile device. They are used only to
      recognise your computer or mobile device when it revisits our site.
    </li>
    <li>Third party cookies, which are served by a service provider on our site, and can be used by the
      service provider to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other sites. Third
      party cookies are most commonly used for platform analytics or advertising purposes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are
    ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted
    automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies,’ meaning that they
    survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the site to recognise our computer or
    mobile device when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.

            These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more
            likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing
            history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that
            information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to
            enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you
            are on third party websites.
          </p>
          <p>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you

            If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but
            they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the
            companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioural
            advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and
            tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.
